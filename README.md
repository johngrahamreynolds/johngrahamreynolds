👋 Hi, I’m @johngrahamreynolds. I finished my <ins>B.S. in Physics, Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University</ins> in May 2020. 

      👱‍♂️🎓📚 I am a Software, Data Engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Jan. 2022 -> present), and
      〈🌌〉 an experienced physicist with interests in Black Holes, General Relativity, and Quantum Gravity.

### See the <ins>Directory</ins> section below for a guide to all the info housed on my page.

My background of research (📖) and professional (🔩) experience includes:

- 📖 Theoretical Physics research on *Black Hole Firewalls* and *the Information Paradox* under PI David Kaplan (General Relativity, Qunatum Mechanics: https://www.quantamagazine.org/videos/what-happens-if-you-fall-into-a-black-hole/)
- 📖 Observational Cosmology and Cryogenics research and development under Co-PIs Tobi Marriage, Chuck Bennett (CLASS Telescope: https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/)
- 🔩 Data, Software, Cloud Engineering
      
👀 I’m interested in ...
