👋 Hi, I’m @johngrahamreynolds. I'm currently a graduate student in the [University of Texas at Austin, Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) and a professional Data, ML Engineer. I work broadly across engineering and the natural sciences as

      ⚛️👨‍💻🧠 a computer scientist at UT Austin with interests in Deep Reasoning, AGI, Quantum Computing, etc.
      〈🌌〉 a mathematical physicist with interests in Quantum Gravity, String Theory, and Pure Mathematics, and
      💻📊📐 a Data, Machine Learning Engineer at Vanderbilt University (2022 -> present)

I finished my <ins>B.S. in Physics, Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University</ins> in May 2020.

### See the <ins>Directory</ins> section below for a guide to all the info housed on my page.

My background of research (📖) and professional (🔩) experience includes:

- 🔩📖 AI and Deep Learning research and engineering - training state-of-the-art multi-million to multi-billion parameter Encoder and Decoder Transformer models ([Hugging Face 🤗 profile](https://huggingface.co/MarioBarbeque))
- 🔩 Using Apache Spark, Cloud Resources, and techniques from High-Performance Computing (amongst many other tools) to engineer Big Data and cloud, ML infrastructure
- 📖 Theoretical Physics research on *Black Holes*, *String Theory*, *General Relativity*, and more - advised by David Kaplan (a fantastic [article and video](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wormhole-entanglement-and-the-firewall-paradox-20150424/) of David explaining the ideas I worked on!)
- 📖 Observational Cosmology and Cryogenics research and development - advised by Co-PIs Toby Marriage, Chuck Bennett ([CLASS Telescope website](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/))
