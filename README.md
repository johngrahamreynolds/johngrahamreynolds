👋 Hi, I’m @johngrahamreynolds. I finished my B.S. in Physics, Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University in 2020. 

      👱‍♂️🎓📚 I am a Software, Data Engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Jan. 2022 -> present), and
      〈🌌〉 an experienced physicist with interests in General Relativity, Black Holes, and Quantum Gravity.


My background of research (📖) and professional (🔩) experience includes:

- 📖 Theoretical Physics research on the Black Hole Information Paradox (General Relativity, Qunatum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime;  https://www.quantamagazine.org/videos/what-happens-if-you-fall-into-a-black-hole/)
- 📖 Observational Cosmology and Cryogenics research and development (CLASS Telescope, https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/)
- 🔩 Data, Software, Cloud Engineering
      
👀 I’m interested in ... 

      🕳🪐🔮 High Energy Theoretical Physics (Black Holes, General Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, Strings/Holography)
      
      🔬🖥🤏 Quantum Information, Quantum Computing (Theory and Development; Cryogenics, Q#, Qiskit and Cirq)
      
      🧠🤖📈 AI, Machine Learning, Quantum ML (TensorFlow, TensorFlow Quantum)
      
      💻🏗🎢 Software, Computer Engineering (C/C++, Python)
      
      💭🧮☯️ Connections between Physics, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Logic, Religion
      
      🧪🚹🚺 Using all the above to consider ways of improving the Human Condition (Brain-Computer Interfaces, etc.)
