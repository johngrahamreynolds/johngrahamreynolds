👋 Hi, I’m @johngrahamreynolds. I finished my <ins>B.S. in Physics, Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University</ins> in May 2020. 

      👱‍♂️🎓📚 I am a Software, Data Engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Jan. 2022 -> present), and
      〈🌌〉 an experienced physicist with interests in General Relativity, Quantum Gravity, and Quantum Computing.

### See the <ins>Directory</ins> section below for a guide to all the info housed on my page.

My background of research (📖) and professional (🔩) experience includes:

- 🔩 Data, Software, Cloud Engineering
- 📖 Theoretical Physics research on *Black Hole Firewalls* and *the Information Paradox* under David Kaplan (General Relativity, Qunatum Mechanics: https://www.quantamagazine.org/videos/what-happens-if-you-fall-into-a-black-hole/)
- 📖 Observational Cosmology and Cryogenics research and development under Co-PIs Toby Marriage, Chuck Bennett (CLASS Telescope: https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/)
      
👀 I’m interested in ... 

      🕳🪐🔮 Theoretical Physics (Black Holes, Quantum Gravity, General Relativity, Quantum Information, Strings/Holography)
      
      🔬🖥🤏 Quantum Information, Quantum Computing (Theory and Development; Cryogenics, Cirq, Q#, and Qiskit)

      ◼️🧮➗ Pure and Applied Mathematics (Differential/Kähler/Calabi-Yau Geometry, Set Theory and Logic/Foundations of Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science)
      
      🤖🏗📈 Software, Computer, AI/ML Engineering (C/C++, Python, TensorFlow, Spark, MLlib, Databricks, etc.)
      
      🧪🚹🚺 Using all the above to consider ways of improving the Human Condition (Brain-Computer Interfaces, Space Exploration, Virtual Reality/ Simulation etc.)
      
🌱 I’m currently learning and solving problems in...

      💻🏔🧠 Classical and Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning (TensorFlow, TensorFlow Quantum)
